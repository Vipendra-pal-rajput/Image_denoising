# Image_denoising : Remove Noise from image [![License: CC BY 4.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-CC%20BY%204.0-lightgrey.svg)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

This repo let's you denoised image that have noise in images. This Repo is mainly focused on document or Notes(Printed) images.
This repo works with opencv-python 4.1.2.30 equal or grater version.

### Overview

To test your own images follow the below steps:

 1. [Original_image](/Original_image/)
	 - Original images
 2. [Denoised_image](/Denoised_image/)
 	- Output images

+  [Denoised_image](/Denoised_image/): Here i am taking input images
+  Then running python programme to check estimated_sigma for each image
+  then applying filters according to estimated_sigma value
+  and finally Replacing input images with denoised_images in same directory
+  made Original_image directory to show you what images we are denoising there is no role of Original image directory.

### Google Colab Tutorial <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vipendra-pal-rajput/Image_denoising/blob/main/Image_denoising.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/></a>
With Google Colab you can skip most of the set up steps and start test on your own images. 

### Requisites
The only hard requirement is a running version of python 3.9. To install python 3.9 go to 
- [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-394/) 

and follow the installation instructions. Note that this repo has only been tested with python 3.9 thus it is recommened to use either `python3.9` or latest `python version`.

To speed up training, it is recommended to use a **GPU with CUDA** support. If you want to use your own machine,for faster perform your system specification should be very high.


## Setting up Run code

Clone this repo with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vipendra-pal-rajput/Image_denoising
```

To test on your own images located in [`Image_denoising/Denoised_image`](/Denoised_image/) run the `image_denoising.py` script in the root folder with:

```bash
python image_denoising.py
```

The outputs are saved in [`Image_denoising/Denoised_image`](/Denoised_image/).
